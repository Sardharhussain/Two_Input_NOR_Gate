## Abstract
The aim of the work is to design a NOR gate in 180nm CMOS technology on ESIM IC Design platform. 
In Digital Electronics, a NOR gate is logic circuit which outputs Logic is high when both the inputs are logic low. 
Other basic gates such as AND, OR, NOT etc. can be designed Using a NOR gate. As it is the series combination of an NOT gate 
And OR gate. Due to this reason, it is called a UNIVERSAL gate.

## Tools used
* ESIM IC Design Platform.
